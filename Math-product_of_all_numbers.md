# Product of all other Numbers

## Description
For each number in an array, find the product of all the other numbers. You can do it faster than you'd think!

## Details
Write a method getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

For example, given:
```
  [1, 7, 3, 4]
```
your method would return:
```
  [84, 12, 28, 21]
```
by calculating:
```
  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]
```
Here's the catch: You can't use division in your solution!
