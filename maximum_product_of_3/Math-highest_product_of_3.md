# Highest product of 3

## Description
Find the highest possible product that you can get by multiplying any 3 numbers from an input array.

## Details
Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.
The input `arrayOfInts` will always have at least three integers.

## Gotchas
Does your method work with negative numbers? If arrayOfInts is [-10, -10, 1, 3, 2] we should return 300300 (which we get by taking -10 \* -10 \* 3).
We can do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.

## Bonus
* What if we wanted the highest product of 4 items?
* What if we wanted the highest product of k items?
* If our highest product is really big, it could overflow. How should we protect against this?
