# Shuffle

**Write a function for doing an in-place shuffle of a list.**

The shuffle must be "uniform," meaning each item in the original list must have the same probability of ending up in each spot in the finallist.

Assume that you have a function get\_random\(floor, ceiling\) for getting a random integer that is &gt;= floor and &lt;= ceiling.
